                    Our team has over 50 years of combined experience, with some of the best results to show. We can help almost any behavioral issue, so feel free to reach out if you're not sure which training is best for your furry friend. We start out with a one-on-one session to get a feel for your pet's areas they need improvement, and formulate a dedicated training plan for them. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We prefer to use methods that you can easily replicate as the owner, allowing for a seamless transition from class to the home. This helps improve the bond between you and your pet, strengthening their trust in you and increasing their willingness to listen to your commands. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We typically see improvements quickly, with most changes occurring within the first 6 weeks. However, realize that dogs from rescue centers or multiple homes may take a little longer than others.
